This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
<!-- {"version":"18957146","hash":"0x87aba5c49ecc459d5a69e2a1c0b77c16a7d179e044530ba95f338a8fbad5a6e6","gas_unit_price":"100","gas_used":"97","sender":"0x92c945f0ec6423e8ec1414a597f1d6fbc954c309f5846cbc73a43b62bfc37eba","sequence_number":"2","timestamp":"1717739530195484","vm_status":"Executed successfully"}  -->

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
